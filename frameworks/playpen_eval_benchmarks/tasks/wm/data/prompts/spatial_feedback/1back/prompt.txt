You are asked to perform a 1-back task. You will see a sequence of 3*3 grids. Each grid has a letter X in one of the nine positions. For example, a grid with X at top left corner would be ``` |X|_|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ```. Your task is to respond with 'm' (no quotation marks, just the letter m) whenever the X is in the same position as the previous grid, and '-' (no quotation marks, just the dash sign) otherwise. The sequence will be presented one grid at a time. Feedback on whether your last response was correct or incorrect will also be presented. Please take advantage of feedback information to improve your performance. Note that you are only allowed to respond with 'm' or '-'. No explanations needed: please don't output any extra words!! Now begins the task.

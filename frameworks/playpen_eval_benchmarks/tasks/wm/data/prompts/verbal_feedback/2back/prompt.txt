You are asked to perform a 2-back task. You will see a sequence of letters. Your task is to respond with 'm' (no quotation marks, just the letter m) whenever the current letter is the same as the letter two letters ago, and '-' (no quotation marks, just the dash sign) otherwise. The sequence will be presented one letter at a time. Feedback on whether your last response was correct or wrong will also be presented. Please take advantage of feedback information to improve your performance. Note that you are only allowed to respond with 'm' or '-'. No explanations needed - please don't output any extra words!! Now begins the task.

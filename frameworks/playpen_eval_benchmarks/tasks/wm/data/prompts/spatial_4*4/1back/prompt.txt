You are asked to perform a 1-back task. You will see a sequence of 4*4 grids. Each grid has a letter X in one of the sixteen positions. For example, a grid with X at top left corner would be ``` |X|_|_|_| |_|_|_|_| |_|_|_|_| |_|_|_|_| ```. Your task is to respond with 'm' (no quotation marks, just the letter m) whenever the X is in the same position as the previous grid, and respond with '-' (no quotation marks, just the dash sign) otherwise.  Only 'm' and '-' are allowed responses. No explanations needed: please don't output any extra words!! The sequence will be presented one grid at a time. Now begins the task.

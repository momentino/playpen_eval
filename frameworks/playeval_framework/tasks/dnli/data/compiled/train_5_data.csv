<B> right it's quite hard to get A and B together sometimes you know to get C but anyway what I think is that if if we work within this context I can see what you do and I can see and I can see that you know you can you can grow this whichever way you want to grow it but I can see why you would be a digital producer in this day and age <A> right okay <B> yeah <A> so what what <B> there you go 	Digital producers are highly paid.	Neutral
<B> and then you go and design it <A> yeah I don't <B> and then I go back and deliver it <A> mm yeah I <B> well you see that's the thing 	Speaker B communicates with clients.	Entailment
<B> yeah so maybe we leave me out of it until you've learnt that and then we work together cos er that's what your driver is is that you want to be at that level and that's when you will be able to work with me cos we'll then be at the same level <A> yeah I understand it in the context of if you were starting out and there was that disparity that's fine but I expect to learn out of that <B> but you'll be learning from me <A> which is absolutely fine as long as it's quick <B> yeah well that's the thing is that if you 	Speaker B has a lot of knowledge.	Neutral
<A> cos you don't wanna take ages to do it <B> it's it's <A> this is I'm I'm very much about shortcutting things to to try and get somewhere fast <B> I know it's <A> yeah well that's part of what this is about this is where I was going from and to yeah? 	Speaker A likes working in a quick tempo.	Entailment
<A> er yeah over time that's where the meeting happens so at the moment I'm doing this learning whatever skills such that when you meet there you're actually operating in the same business as partners rather than a differentiator and what would be better is that you're both working at that level and you have others that are working at the other level yeah? <B> so when I originally asked you the question why did you put me somewhere around about here then? <A> erm because <B> well that's all I thought I'd simplified for you by giving you that <A> no yeah but that 	Speaker A has some meetings at work.	Entailment
<A> or what the purpose for it was <B> but you still gave me the answer that I was looking for which is how your mind works <A> that was in context of that right? okay? <B> yeah so draw me <A> but this was a whole different thing this is forget that forget that 	Speaker B is very intuitive.	Neutral
<B> well I think yeah er the the <A> mm <B> the thing is is that normally you get a client first you go great <A> mm <B> and then it becomes what I'm calling a business is that it starts to actually earn some money over a period of time and that's what I call business but first project and then you grow business gotta get a project first 	The topic of the conversation is business.

<B> come into that industry unless you'd actually be sort of vaguely interested in it <A> okay so if you've got if you've got <B> cos a digital producer is you could go and work for a company like <A> yeah but what I'm trying to connect together are the two things that we are interested in right? <B> but what are the two things we're interested in?

<A> yeah and that in the context of the way that erm the modern world is heading a lot of that is the visually-based output <A> and so if you have the digital skills being that you can make the film you can make the text you can make the imagery whatever the audio to put all of that stuff together that you can create that and you can publish it and you publish it through digital output and so the stuff I've been talking about as the digital producer is that you know? <B> okay I'm gonna <A> mm <B> from about early nineteen nineties okay?

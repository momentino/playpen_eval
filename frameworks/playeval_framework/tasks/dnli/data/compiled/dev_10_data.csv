<A> you should n't have to to do it or join it as justification for getting them to change the rules I mean if you like you can just make a statement saying that it is that you feel it 's sexist in fact if you want I can film you saying this and I can put it on Youtube if you prefer ? <C> I think Twister would be better because <A> you think Twister ?

<C> can we also complain to the people in the law so even so if Brownies does n't do it then it might need to shut down because if it 's sexist ? <A> well I think that would be a bit harsh but I think we will start with a campaign where we even where we contact the Brownies ' head directly and then if we 're not happy with what they say then we 'll go public on Twitter <C> yeah and if and then if we 're still not happy loads of people are going oh no no no it 's brilliant that there 's loads of places there 's finding a place where there 's no boys and just girls then it then we might need to go to the head the people in the law <A> well yes which well that would cost money so it would be a bit tricky but they might decide that you could be an honorary Brownie in <C> yeah er I 'll ask my friends if they want if they would n't mind if they became a Brownie <A> yeah that would be interesting take a poll <C> because I 'd like to have some friends there <A> well you 've got loads of friends you 've got <C> yeah I think quite a few people have a crush on me <B> mm mm mm mm 	Speaker C used to be very popular among Brownie girls in school .

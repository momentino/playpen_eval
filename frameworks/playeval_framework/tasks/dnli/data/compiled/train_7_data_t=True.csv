<A> no no what i 'm saying is over time that that is where the meeting happens yeah ? <B> oh i see <A> er yeah over time that 's where the meeting happens so at the moment i 'm doing this learning whatever skills such that when you meet there you 're actually operating in the same business as partners rather than a differentiator and what would be better is that you 're both working at that level and you have others that are working at the other level yeah ? <B> so when i originally asked you the question why did you put me somewhere around about here then ? <A> erm because <B> well that 's all i thought i 'd simplified for you by giving you that <A> no yeah but that 	speaker a has some meetings at work .

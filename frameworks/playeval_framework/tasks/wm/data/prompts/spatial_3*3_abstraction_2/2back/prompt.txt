You are asked to perform a 1-back task. You will see a sequence of 3*3 grids. Each grid has a letter X in one of the nine positions. For example, a grid with X at top left corner would be ``` |X|_|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ```. Your task is to respond with 'm' (no quotation marks, just the letter m) whenever the X in the current grid is in the same row or column as the X in the previous grid, and '-' (no quotation marks, just the dash sign) otherwise. For example, the X in ``` |X|_|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ``` is in the same row as the X in ``` |_|X|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ``` and ``` |_|_|X| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ```, and in the same column as the X in ``` |_|_|_| |X|_|_| |_|_|_| ``` and ``` |_|_|_| |_|_|_| |X|_|_| ```. Note that if the X in the previous grid was at the identical location to the X in the current grid, that does not count as a match: for example, ``` |X|_|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ``` is not a match to ``` |X|_|_| |_|_|_| |_|_|_| ``` itself. The sequence will be presented one grid at a time. Note that you are only allowed to respond with 'm' or '-'. No explanations needed: please don't output any extra words!! Now begins the task.

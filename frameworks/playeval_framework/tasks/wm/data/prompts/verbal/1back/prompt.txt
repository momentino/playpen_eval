You are asked to perform a 1-back task. You will see a sequence of letters. Your task is to respond with 'm' (no quotation marks, just the letter m) whenever the current letter is the same as the previous one, and '-' (no quotation marks, just the dash sign) otherwise. Only 'm' and '-' are allowed responses. No explanations needed: please don't output any extra words!! The sequence will be presented one letter at a time. Now begins the task.
